# Aeronautical Occurrences Analytics
#### Project Status: <font color="orange"> In Progress </font>

## Introduction
This project is part of a series of dedicated studies in the field of Data Engineering and Analytics, 
where I aim to apply data engineering and analytics techniques to analyze data in its various forms and from any source.
My main goal is to replicate real-world scenarios and develop a portfolio of projects that will extend my knowledge and 
skills in the field.

I also aim to turn this repository into a crash-course for beginners in the field of data engineering and analytics,
and present a step-by-step guide on how to approach a data analytics project, from data extraction
to data visualization, and I intend to present this as a course at the Academic Week of the Federal Institute 
where I currently study.


## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to **analyze historical aeronautical occurrences data**, 
which includes incidents, accidents, and other significant events in aviation. By applying advanced 
data analytics techniques, we aim to identify patterns, trends, 
and correlations that might not be immediately apparent.

## Topics
* Data Extraction
* Data Manipulation
* Data Visualization
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* SQLite
* Jupyter Notebook
* Apache Airflow
* etc.

## Project Description
This project uses data from the government database (gov.br). The primary questions we aim to answer include:

> 1. What are the common patterns in aeronautical occurrences?
> 2. Are there any trends in these occurrences over time?
> 3. Can we find any correlations between different types of occurrences?
